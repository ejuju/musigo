# Quick notes

### Ideas for later

- [ ] Generate midi notes and chords variables with code generation
- [ ] Separate file encoder from player
- [ ] Add feature to decode PCM / MP3 / WAV into a playable wave
- [ ] Add script to play song file from docker cotnainer (so you don't have to install players)
- [ ] Improve perf, add concurrency to improve wave to pulse conversion calculations and decoding / encoding
- [ ] Implement filters by checking  the amplitude and adjusting the float64 in consequence
- [ ] Have instrument tracks send their waves by chunk to a central engine
